In the summer of 1956, the term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined at the Dartmouth Conference, igniting a quest to create thinking machines. A group of brilliant minds gathered to explore the realm of machine intelligence, sparked by the audacious idea that we could create machines that think like humans.  In the early days, optimism soared as pioneers like Allen Newell and John McCarthy paved the way for AI research.  They dreamed of machines that could solve complex problems, understand natural language, and even mimic human creativity.  They soon realized that these lofty aspirations were more challenging than they initially thought. 

Over the years, researchers explored symbolic AI in the 1960s and faced challenges in capturing human cognition. However, the rise of machine learning in the 1980s, driven by computing power and data, brought new hope. Fast forward to the 21st century, and AI became an unstoppable force, permeating our lives in ways we never thought possible. Smartphones became our trusted companions, understanding our voice commands and anticipating our needs. Autonomous vehicles navigated the streets with increasing precision, challenging our notions of what’s possible. AI transformed industries, from healthcare to finance, revolutionizing the way we tackle problems and make decisions. 

Today, AI continues to evolve at an astonishing pace. Deep learning algorithms, inspired by the human brain, have pushed the boundaries of what machines can comprehend and achieve. We stand on the precipice of a future where AI promises to revolutionize every aspect of our existence, from enhancing our creativity to solving global challenges.
